                         i.MX6 Video Capture Driver
                         ==========================

Introduction
------------

The Freescale i.MX6 contains an Image Processing Unit (IPU), which
handles the flow of image frames to and from capture devices and
display devices.

For image capture, the IPU contains the following subunits:

- Image DMA Controller (IDMAC)
- Camera Serial Interface (CSI)
- Image Converter (IC)
- Sensor Multi-FIFO Controller (SMFC)
- Image Rotator (IRT)
- Video De-Interlace Controller (VDIC)

The IDMAC is the DMA controller for transfer of image frames to and from
memory. Various dedicated DMA channels exist for both video capture and
display paths.

The CSI is the frontend capture unit that interfaces directly with
capture devices over Parallel, BT.656, and MIPI CSI-2 busses.

The IC handles color-space conversion, resizing, and rotation
operations.

The SMFC is used to send image frames directly to memory, bypassing the
IC. The SMFC is used when no color-space conversion or resizing is
required, i.e. the requested V4L2 formats and color-space are identical
to raw frames from the capture device.

The IRT carries out 90 and 270 degree image rotation operations.

Finally, the VDIC handles the conversion of interlaced video to
progressive, with support for different motion compensation modes (low
and high).

For more info, refer to the latest versions of the i.MX6 reference
manuals listed under References.


Features
--------

Some of the features of this driver include:

- Supports parallel, BT.565, and MIPI CSI-2 interfaces.

- Camera Preview mode.

- Multiple subdev sensors can be registered and controlled by a single
  interface driver instance. Input enumeration will list every registered
  sensor's inputs and input names, and setting an input will switch to
  a different sensor if the input index is handled by a different sensor.

- Simultaneous streaming from two separate sensors is possible with two
  interface driver instances, each instance controlling a different
  sensor. This is currently possible with the SabreSD reference board
  with OV5642 and MIPI CSI-2 OV5640 sensors.

- Separate rotation control for both streaming and preview. Streaming
  rotation control is via main video device node, and preview rotation
  control via subdevice node.

- Scaling and color-space conversion for both streaming and preview.

- Many pixel formats supported (RGB, packed and planar YUV, partial
  planar YUV).

- Full device-tree support using OF graph bindings.

- Analog decoder input video source hot-swap support (during streaming)
  via decoder status change subdev notification.

- MMAP, USERPTR, and DMABUF importer/exporter buffers supported.

- Motion compensated de-interlacing using the VDIC, with three
  motion compensation modes: low, medium, and high motion. The mode is
  specified with a custom control.


Usage Notes
-----------

The i.MX6 capture driver is a standardized driver that supports the
following community V4L2 tools:

- v4l2-ctl
- v4l2-cap
- v4l2src gstreamer plugin


The following platforms have been tested:


SabreLite with parallel-interface OV5642
----------------------------------------

This platform requires the OmniVision OV5642 module with a parallel
camera interface from Boundary Devices for the SabreLite
(http://boundarydevices.com/products/nit6x_5mp/).

There is a pin conflict between OV5642 and ethernet devices on this
platform, so by default video capture is disabled in the device tree. To
enable video capture, edit arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6qdl-sabrelite.dtsi and
uncomment the macro __OV5642_CAPTURE__.


SabreAuto with ADV7180 decoder
------------------------------

This platform accepts Composite Video analog inputs on Ain1 (connector
J42) and Ain3 (connector J43).

To switch to Ain1:

# v4l2-ctl -i0

To switch to Ain3:

# v4l2-ctl -i1


SabreSD with MIPI CSI-2 OV5640
------------------------------

The default device tree for SabreSD includes endpoints for both the
parallel OV5642 and the MIPI CSI-2 OV5640, but as of this writing only
the MIPI CSI-2 OV5640 has been tested. The OV5640 module connects to
MIPI connector J5 (sorry I don't have the compatible module part number
or URL).

Inputs are registered for both the OV5642 and OV5640, and by default the
OV5642 is selected. To switch to the OV5640:

# v4l2-ctl -i1


Preview Notes
-------------

Preview accepts a framebuffer physaddr via standard VIDIOC_S_FBUF. The
driver is agnostic about the source of this framebuffer, it could come
from a DRM-based background or overlay plane, or from legacy fbdev.

Preview is implemented as a sub-device, and exports controls to
allow preview horizontal/vertical flip and rotation settings independent
of the same settings for streaming. These controls are available on
/dev/v4l-subdev0.


Known Issues
------------

There is one currently known issue. When using 90 or 270 degree rotation
control at capture resolutions near the IC resizer limit of 1024x1024,
and combined with planar pixel formats (YUV420, YUV422p), frame capture
will often fail with no end-of-frame interrupts from the IDMAC channel.
To work around this, use lower resolution and/or packed formats (YUYV,
RGB3, etc.) when 90 or 270 rotations are needed.
